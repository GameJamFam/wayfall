Kids today, always on their devices. Why, three months ago when I was just a spawn not that much bigger than you I swam all the way to the top! Do you know what I found?\n\n...Do you? Honestly, my memory is a bit foggy. \n\nOh yes! Some sort of [i]strange device[/i]. I thought it was neat, so I told my friend about it (rest his shrimp soul). Well, he tells a friend, and that friend tells two friends, and long story short? The entirety of civilization decides to come tear it apart!\n\nI'd love to see it rebuilt, but you'll need to take back the three components from far-flung reaches. I'd do it myself, but my programs are on. Be a good sport and take care of it for ol' Gramps, wouldn't you?"
